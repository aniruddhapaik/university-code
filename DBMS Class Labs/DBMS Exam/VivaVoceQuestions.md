# CSCA 416: DBMS LAB - Bits

1. In normalization, the process of eliminating redundancy and organizing data into smaller tables is known as **\_\_\_\_**.
2. The concept of separating the logical schema from the physical schema is known as **\_\_\_\_**.
3. A **\_\_\_\_** is an attribute or a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a record in a relation.
4. A **\_\_\_\_** constraint ensures that no two rows in a table have the same values for the set of specified attributes.
5. What is the formula to find the block address in the Disk \_\_\_\_?
6. A **\_\_\_\_** is a collection of related data organized in a way that allows easy access, retrieval, and management.
7. **\_\_\_\_** is a concurrency control mechanism used to ensure that multiple transactions can be executed safely in parallel.
8. **\_\_\_\_** is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work in a database management system.
9. The relationship between two tables where each record in the first table can relate to many records in the second table, but each record in the second table relates to only one record in the first table is called a **\_\_\_\_** relationship.
10. In a database system, enforcing **\_\_\_\_** ensures that no conflicting operations are performed on shared data concurrently.

# Transactions and how they work as a single logical unit of work in a database management system.

A transaction in a database context is a sequence of operations that are executed as a single unit. The idea is that these operations are either all successfully completed or none of them are, ensuring data integrity. The key properties of transactions are often described by the acronym ACID, which stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

### Example 1: Bank Transfer

Consider a bank transfer operation between two accounts. The transaction might include the following sequence of operations:

1. **Subtract $500 from Account A**
2. **Add $500 to Account B**

These operations must both succeed or fail together. If the system crashes after subtracting the amount from Account A but before adding it to Account B, the transaction would leave the database in an inconsistent state. Hence, both operations are treated as a single logical unit.

### Example 2: Order Processing

Imagine an e-commerce platform where placing an order involves several steps:

1. **Insert a new order record**
2. **Update inventory to reflect the sold items**
3. **Create a shipment record**

These operations should all be part of a single transaction. If any one of these operations fails, the entire transaction should be rolled back to maintain consistency.

### Query Example

The query provided involves modifying the structure of a table:

1. **ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN newcolumn INT**
2. **ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN newcolumn SET NOT NULL**

In SQL, each `ALTER TABLE` statement is considered a separate transaction. So, in this case, these two operations are not automatically executed as a single transaction. They are distinct operations. If you want to ensure they are treated as a single logical unit, you can use explicit transaction control statements:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

ALTER TABLE your_table ADD COLUMN newcolumn INT;
ALTER TABLE your_table ALTER COLUMN newcolumn SET NOT NULL;

COMMIT;
```

In the example above, `BEGIN TRANSACTION` starts the transaction, and `COMMIT` ends the transaction, ensuring that both operations are executed together as a single unit. If any operation fails, you can use `ROLLBACK` to undo all the changes made during the transaction.

I hope this helps clarify the concept of transactions and how they work in database systems!

**Starvation** in transactions occurs when a transaction is perpetually denied access to the resources it needs, often due to higher-priority transactions or unfair locking mechanisms. To rectify and prevent starvation, a system must ensure fairness in resource allocation and transaction processing.

# **Ways to Rectify Starvation**

---

### **1. Aging Mechanism**

- **Description:**
  - Gradually increase the priority of waiting transactions over time.
  - As a transaction waits longer, its priority increases, eventually allowing it to acquire the needed lock or resource.
- **Example:**

  - If a transaction \( T1 \) has been waiting for a lock for 10 seconds, it may be given a higher priority than a newly arrived transaction \( T2 \), even if \( T2 \) initially had a higher priority.

- **Implementation:**
  - Maintain a timestamp for each transaction indicating when it started waiting.
  - Adjust scheduling algorithms to prioritize older transactions.

---

### **2. Fair Scheduling**

- **Description:**

  - Use a **first-come, first-served (FCFS)** approach for resource allocation.
  - Transactions are granted locks or resources in the order they requested them, preventing indefinite delays.

- **Example:**
  - A queue can be maintained for each resource. Transactions are serviced in the order they arrive in the queue.

---

### **3. Limit Transaction Retries**

- **Description:**

  - Restrict the number of times a transaction can be aborted and restarted due to contention.
  - If a transaction hits the retry limit, it is prioritized to complete rather than being restarted again.

- **Implementation:**
  - Track the number of retries for each transaction.
  - Promote transactions with higher retry counts to ensure completion.

---

### **4. Timeout and Backoff Strategies**

- **Description:**
  - Introduce random backoff times for transactions that are waiting for locks. This reduces contention and prevents a single transaction from repeatedly dominating resources.
  - Transactions that reach a timeout period are prioritized for execution or are escalated for manual intervention.

---

### **5. Lock Timeout Mechanisms**

- **Description:**

  - Set a maximum time a transaction can hold a lock or wait for one.
  - If the timeout expires, the lock is released, and the transaction waiting the longest is granted the lock.

- **Implementation:**
  - Use timeout-based locking policies, ensuring locks are not held indefinitely.

---

### **6. Deadlock Detection and Resolution**

- **Description:**
  - Starvation can sometimes occur due to a related deadlock scenario where low-priority transactions are repeatedly aborted.
  - Implement deadlock detection and resolution mechanisms to resolve circular waits.

---

### **7. Priority-Based Resource Allocation with Dynamic Adjustments**

- **Description:**
  - Use a priority system to allocate resources. Initially assign priorities based on transaction types (e.g., read-only vs. read-write), but dynamically adjust them based on wait time or system policies.

---

### **8. Promote Long-Waiting Transactions**

- **Description:**

  - If a transaction has been waiting beyond a predefined threshold, promote it to the highest priority, bypassing normal scheduling rules.

- **Implementation:**
  - Monitor waiting times and escalate older transactions to ensure progress.

---

### **9. Avoid Priority Inversion**

- **Description:**
  - Ensure that low-priority transactions do not hold resources needed by high-priority ones for an extended time.
  - Allow high-priority transactions to temporarily "inherit" the priority of a blocked transaction to avoid blocking.

---

### **10. Use of Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)**

- **Description:**
  - Instead of locking resources, transactions execute without locks and validate at the commit stage to detect conflicts.
  - This reduces contention and the likelihood of starvation.

---

### **11. Monitoring and Alerts**

- **Description:**
  - Continuously monitor the system for signs of starvation.
  - Alert database administrators to take corrective actions if a transaction remains in a waiting state for too long.

---

### **Example Solution in SQL Systems**

If using a **timeout mechanism** with aging:

1. Implementing lock timeout:

   ```sql
   SET LOCK_TIMEOUT 5000; -- Set timeout to 5 seconds
   ```

2. Adjusting transaction priorities dynamically:
   ```sql
   UPDATE transaction_queue
   SET priority = priority + 1
   WHERE wait_time > 10; -- Increase priority for long-waiting transactions
   ```

---

By combining these techniques, you can effectively reduce or eliminate starvation, ensuring that all transactions are eventually granted access to the resources they need.

The **N-Queens Problem**, solved using **backtracking**, involves placing \(N\) queens on an \(N \times N\) chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The time complexity of the solution depends on the depth of the recursion and the work done at each level.

---

### **Problem Description**

The problem is solved by incrementally placing queens column by column while checking for constraints:

1. No two queens are in the same row.
2. No two queens are in the same column.
3. No two queens are on the same diagonal.

If a placement violates the constraints, the algorithm backtracks to try a different configuration.

---

### **Reasoning Behind Time Complexity**

#### **1. Decision Tree Representation**

The backtracking solution explores all possible configurations of placing \(N\) queens:

- At each column, there are \(N\) possible rows to place the queen.
- This leads to a decision tree with up to \(N^N\) configurations (in the worst case).

However, constraints significantly prune the search space, reducing the actual number of configurations explored.

---

#### **2. Constraints and Pruning**

- **Row Constraint**: Since only one queen can be placed in each column, thereâ€™s no need to check the same row for subsequent columns.
- **Diagonal Constraints**:
  - Left diagonal: Difference \(row - column\) must be unique.
  - Right diagonal: Sum \(row + column\) must be unique.

By maintaining sets or arrays for these constraints, the algorithm efficiently checks whether a position is valid in \(O(1)\) time.

---

#### **3. Recursive Backtracking**

The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. Place a queen in the first column.
2. Recur to place a queen in the next column, ensuring constraints are satisfied.
3. If all queens are placed, record the solution.
4. If placing a queen leads to a dead end (no valid positions in the next column), backtrack to the previous column and try the next row.

---

#### **Time Complexity Analysis**

1. **Depth of the Recursion Tree**:

   - There are \(N\) columns to fill, so the depth of the recursion tree is \(N\).

2. **Number of Choices at Each Level**:

   - At the first column, there are \(N\) choices (rows) for the queen.
   - After placing the first queen, constraints reduce the choices for the next column. In the worst case, there can still be \(N-1\) choices, then \(N-2\), and so on.

   However, pruning significantly reduces the number of valid configurations, especially for larger \(N\).

3. **Total Nodes Explored**:

   - In the worst-case scenario (with no pruning), the algorithm explores \(N!\) (factorial of \(N\)) nodes in the tree. This is because:
     \[
     N \cdot (N-1) \cdot (N-2) \cdots \cdot 1 = N!
     \]

4. **Pruning Impact**:
   - Pruning reduces the number of nodes explored, but it is difficult to quantify precisely as it depends on the structure of the solution space. The actual number of nodes explored is much smaller than \(N!\), especially for larger \(N\).

---

#### **Space Complexity**

The space complexity is:

1. **Recursive Stack**: \(O(N)\), as the recursion depth is equal to the number of columns.
2. **Constraint Storage**:
   - Arrays or sets to store row, left diagonal, and right diagonal constraints: \(O(N)\).

Thus, the total space complexity is \(O(N)\).

---

### **Final Complexity**

- **Time Complexity**: The theoretical upper bound is \(O(N!)\) for \(N\) queens due to factorial growth in the number of configurations. However, with pruning, the actual complexity is much lower but problem-dependent.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\).

---

### **Example: 4-Queens Problem**

For \(N = 4\), the recursion tree explores these configurations:

1. Place a queen in the first column (\(4\) choices).
2. Place a queen in the second column, considering constraints (\(2\) valid choices).
3. Repeat for subsequent columns, pruning invalid configurations.

The algorithm terminates after finding \(2\) valid solutions and backtracking through \(16\) total configurations.

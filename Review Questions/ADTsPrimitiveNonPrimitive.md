Not all non-primitive data structures are necessarily considered abstract data types (ADTs), but many are. Here's how they relate:

### **Primitive vs. Non-Primitive Data Structures**

- **Primitive Data Structures:** These are the basic types provided directly by the programming language, such as integers, floats, characters, and booleans.
- **Non-Primitive Data Structures:** These are more complex and include arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.

### **Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**

An **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** is a theoretical concept that defines the behavior or operations of a data structure, independent of its implementation. It specifies _what_ a data structure does, not _how_ it does it.

### Classification of Examples

#### **1. Arrays**

- **Not always considered an ADT**: An array is often regarded as a concrete data structure because its implementation (contiguous memory allocation) is closely tied to its behavior. However, when viewed purely in terms of its interface (e.g., accessing elements by index), it could be treated as an ADT.

#### **2. Stacks**

- **Yes, an ADT**: A stack is an ADT defined by the "last in, first out" (LIFO) behavior. Its implementation can vary (e.g., using an array or linked list).

#### **3. Queues**

- **Yes, an ADT**: A queue is defined by the "first in, first out" (FIFO) behavior. Like a stack, it can be implemented in multiple ways.

#### **4. Linked Lists**

- **Not typically an ADT**: A linked list is more often considered a concrete data structure because it specifies how nodes are connected in memory (through pointers). However, some might consider a linked list an ADT if focusing on its interface (traversal, insertion, deletion).

#### **5. Trees**

- **Usually considered an ADT**: A tree (e.g., binary tree) defines a hierarchical structure and operations like traversal or insertion. Its specific implementation (e.g., using nodes and pointers) is a separate concern.

#### **6. Graphs**

- **Usually considered an ADT**: A graph defines a structure of nodes (vertices) and edges. How this is implemented (e.g., adjacency matrix or adjacency list) is an implementation detail.

### **Key Distinction**

- A **data structure** refers to the specific way data is organized and implemented in memory.
- An **ADT** defines the behavior and operations, independent of implementation.

In summary:

- Arrays and linked lists are generally considered **concrete data structures**, not ADTs.
- Stacks, queues, trees, and graphs are usually considered **ADTs**, as they emphasize behavior over implementation.

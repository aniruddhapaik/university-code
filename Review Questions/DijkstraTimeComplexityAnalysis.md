The time complexity of **Dijkstra's Algorithm** depends on the **implementation details** (data structures) used and the graph's representation. Let’s break down the reasoning:

---

### **Dijkstra’s Algorithm Overview**

Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with **non-negative edge weights**. It employs a **greedy approach** by maintaining a priority queue (min-heap) to repeatedly select the vertex with the smallest tentative distance.

---

### **Key Operations in Dijkstra’s Algorithm**

1. **Initialization**:

   - Set the distance of the source vertex to 0 and all others to infinity.
   - Use a priority queue (min-heap) to store vertices based on their current distance.
   - Initially, the priority queue contains the source vertex with a distance of 0.

2. **Relaxation**:

   - Extract the vertex with the smallest distance from the priority queue (min-heap extraction).
   - For each neighbor of this vertex, update its distance if a shorter path is found.
   - Push the updated neighbor into the priority queue if the distance is improved.

3. **Repeat** until all vertices are processed or the queue is empty.

### **Time Complexity Analysis**

The time complexity depends on two main factors:

1. **Graph Representation** (Adjacency Matrix or Adjacency List).
2. **Priority Queue Operations**.

#### **1. Priority Queue Operations**

- **Insertion** and **Decrease-Key** operations: \(O(\log V)\) for a binary heap.
- **Extract-Min** operation: \(O(\log V)\).

#### **2. Graph Representation**

- **Adjacency List**: Iterating over neighbors takes \(O(E)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges.
- **Adjacency Matrix**: Checking neighbors takes \(O(V^2)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices.

---

### **Complexity with Adjacency List and Binary Heap**

1. **Initialization**:

   - Assigning initial distances: \(O(V)\).
   - Priority queue initialization: \(O(V)\).

2. **Relaxation**:
   - Extracting \(V\) vertices from the priority queue: \(V \cdot O(\log V) = O(V \log V)\).
   - Iterating over all edges for relaxation: \(O(E)\).
     - Each edge may lead to a decrease-key operation in the priority queue: \(O(\log V)\).
     - Total for \(E\) edges: \(O(E \log V)\).

#### **Total Time Complexity**:

- \(O((V + E) \log V)\), simplified as:
  - **Sparse Graphs (\(E \approx V\))**: \(O(V \log V)\).
  - **Dense Graphs (\(E \approx V^2\))**: \(O(V^2 \log V)\).

---

### **Complexity with Adjacency Matrix**

1. **Initialization**:

   - Assigning initial distances: \(O(V)\).

2. **Relaxation**:
   - Extracting \(V\) vertices: \(O(V^2)\) (since no priority queue is used, but a simple linear scan for the minimum vertex).
   - Checking all neighbors for each vertex: \(O(V^2)\).

#### **Total Time Complexity**:

- \(O(V^2)\), independent of edge count.

### **Summary of Time Complexities**

| **Graph Representation** | **Priority Queue**   | **Time Complexity**   | **Graph Type**              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Adjacency List           | Binary Heap          | \(O((V + E) \log V)\) | Efficient for sparse graphs |
| Adjacency List           | Fibonacci Heap       | \(O(V \log V + E)\)   | Optimized, rarely used      |
| Adjacency Matrix         | None (Linear Search) | \(O(V^2)\)            | Efficient for dense graphs  |

---

### **Why Does Adjacency List with Binary Heap Dominate in Practice?**

- **Sparse Graphs**: In real-world applications, most graphs are sparse (\(E \ll V^2\)), making the adjacency list more efficient.
- **Priority Queue (Binary Heap)**: Achieves a balance between fast updates (\(\log V\)) and compact storage.

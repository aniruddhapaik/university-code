   Give the outputs when you apply preorder, inorder and post order traversals.
4. Discuss the various operations on Doubly Linked List.
5. Analyze the working principles of the algorithms used to find Minimum Spanning Tree.
6. Construct a binary search tree by inserting 3, 1, 4, 9, 6, 5, 2, 8 and 7 into an initially empty tree.\
   Show the results of deleting the nodes 1,6 and 7 one after the other of the constructed tree.
